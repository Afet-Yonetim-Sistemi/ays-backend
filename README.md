For your feature branches, please ensure below:

- Make sure to associate your feature branch with the GitHub issue from 'Development' section in each issue page.
- main branch is protected.
- Your feature branches can be merged by pull request that is approved by at least one code owner.
- PR should be squash-merged to avoid having merge commit history.
- PR title and description should clearly define and explain the aim.
- PR title should contain the issue/feature/bug number e.g. Issue 7 - Readme Update
- PR should successfully complete build and any other necessary tests before being merged to main.
- Branches should follow the below pattern:
    feature/issue-no-other-desc
    bugfix/issue-no-other-desc
    hotfix/issue-no-other-desc (there may also be no issue number for some hotfixes)
- Each release should be tagged with a version
- Commit messages should be subjectless
    e.g. Add README.md
    e.g. Fix ...
- PR should be concise; don't try to fix/introduce more than one thing
- Do not include/push secret/credential information
