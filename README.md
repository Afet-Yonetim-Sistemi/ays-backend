# Getting Started

---

The project has been generated by Spring Initializer.

## Instructions Before Building Project

⚠ Make sure NOT to push `template-settings.xml` at all times. ⚠

First of all, generate personal access token with this url : https://github.com/settings/tokens

- Create one classic token
- Make sure to give project, read:packages, repo scopes
- Give it a name
- Then click on "Generate Token"
- In case of errors, please check [here](#Common Maven errors)

# Before Running Locally On IDE

> 0. If you don't want to replace your `~/m2/settings.xml` file, use following command to build the project (go to the root folder of the application): `mvn -gs template-settings.xml clean install -U`
> 1. If you have `~/m2/settings.xml` file in your computer, skip the step without reading the after section.
     If you aren't using the `~/.m2/settings.xml` file to actively, you can be back up it before creating
     the new `settings.xml` file, if you want. If you are using actively, after the perform step 3 you can
     manually merge the `settings.xml` file in the project with the `~/.m2/settings.xml` file and skip step 2 and 4.
> 2. While inside the project directory in the terminal; that is, when you are in the `~/afet-yonetim-sistemi/ays-be`
     directory, run the command `cp template-settings.xml settings.xml`.
> 3. In the settings.xml file within the project, replace the `{YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}` placeholder with your GitHub
     username and replace `{YOUR_PERSONAL_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN}` with the access token value you created on GitHub as
     described in the instructions under the `'Instructions Before Building The Project'` section.
> 4. If the `.m2` directory has not been created before, you can use the command `mkdir ~/.m2` and then run the
     command `cp settings.xml ~/.m2/settings.xml` for copy the `settings.xml` file located in the project
     to the `~/.m2` directory.

#### Don't forget to enable Lombok pre-processing in your IDE!

## Building The Project With Tests

```
./mvnw clean install
```

## Building The Project Without Tests

```
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
```

## Running as Docker MySQL container

Before running the project, you need to run the following command to start the MySQL container:

```
docker compose up -d --build database
```

If you want to recreate the MySQL container, you can run the following command:

```
docker compose up --force-recreate -d --build database
```

If you want to stop the MySQL container, you can run the following command:

```
docker compose down -v database
```

# Running As Docker Container

> 1. While inside the project directory in the terminal; that is, when you are in the `~/afet-yonetim-sistemi/ays-be`
     directory, run the command `cp template-settings.xml settings.xml`.
> 2. In the `settings.xml` file within the project, replace the `{YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}` placeholder with your GitHub
     username and replace `{YOUR_PERSONAL_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN}` with the access token value you created on GitHub as
     described in the instructions under the `'Instructions Before Building The Project'` section.

Before running the project, you need to run the following command to start the project container:

```
docker compose up -d --build
```

If you want to recreate the project container, you can run the following command:

```
docker compose up --force-recreate -d --build 
```

If you want to stop the project container, you can run the following command:

```
docker compose down -v 
```
