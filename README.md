# Getting Started

---

The project has been generated by Spring Initializer.

## Instructions Before Building Project

First of all, generate personal access token with this url : https://github.com/settings/tokens

# Before Running Locally On IDE

> 1. If you haven't `~/m2/settings.xml` file skip the step without reading the after section.
     If you aren't using the `~/.m2/settings.xml` file to actively, you can be back up it before creating
     the new `settings.xml` file, if you want. If you are using actively, after the perform step 3 you can
     manually merge the `settings.xml` file in the project with the `~/.m2/settings.xml` file and skip step 2 and 4.
> 2. While inside the project directory in the terminal; that is, when you are in the `~/afet-yonetim-sistemi/ays-be`
     directory, run the command `cp template-settings.xml settings.xml`.
> 3. In the settings.xml file within the project, replace the `{YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}` placeholder with your GitHub
     username and replace `{YOUR_PERSONAL_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN}` with the access token value you created on GitHub as
     described in the instructions under the `'Instructions Before Building The Project'` section.
> 4. If the `.m2` directory has not been created before, you can use the command `mkdir ~/.m2` and then run the
     command `cp settings.xml ~/.m2/settings.xml` for copy the `settings.xml` file located in the project
     to the `~/.m2` directory.

#### Don't forget to enable Lombok pre-processing in your IDE!

## Building The Project With Tests

```
./mvnw clean install
```

## Building The Project Without Tests

```
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
```

## Running as Docker MySQL container

Before running the project, you need to run the following command to start the MySQL container:

```
docker compose up -d --build database
```

If you want to recreate the MySQL container, you can run the following command:

```
docker compose up --force-recreate -d --build database
```

If you want to stop the MySQL container, you can run the following command:

```
docker compose down -v database
```

- Make sure to associate your feature branch with the GitHub issue from 'Development' section in each issue page.
- main branch is protected.
- PR should be linked to the relevant issue within the GitHub Project.
- Your feature branches can be merged by pull request that is approved by at least one code owner.
- PR should be squash-merged to avoid having merge commit history.
- PR title and description should clearly define and explain the aim.
- PR title should contain the issue/feature/bug number e.g. Issue 7 - Readme Update
- PR should successfully complete build and any other necessary tests before being merged to main.

- `feature/{issue-number}/{optional-description}`
    - Ex: `feature/0/admin-register-flow` or `feature/0`
- `refactor/{issue-number}/{optional-description}`
    - Ex: `refactor/0/tests-classes` or `refactor/0`
- `hotfix/{issue-number}/{optional-description}`
    - Ex: `hotfix/0/authorization-flow` or `hotfix/0`

**Naming Conventions of Pull Requests**

- `#{issue-number} | {header-for-summary-of-development}`
